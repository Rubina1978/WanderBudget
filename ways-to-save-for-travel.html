                When you finally decide to pursue your travel dream, one of the
                first questions after choosing a destination is often

                preferences, and choices. Let’s explore a few ideas to help make
                your trip a reality, even in challenging times.

          <h3>Ways to save money</h3>
          <div class="col-12 mt-4">
            <article>
              <h4 id="outgoings">Make a list of money in and out</h4>
              <p>
                When you want to save money for a holiday, the first step is to
                set a clear goal: decide where you want to travel and estimate
                how much it will cost. Having a destination and budget in mind
                will give your savings a purpose and keep you motivated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next step is to review your finances. Look closely at how
                much money comes in each month, how much goes out, and where
                it’s being spent. The clearer your picture of income and
                expenses, the easier and quicker it will be for you to save for
                your dream trip.
              </p>

          <div class="col-12">
            <article>
              <h4 id="debts">Pay your debts first</h4>
              <p>
                When you decide it's time to go travel to explore the world
                around you, it’s tempting to start saving straight away — but if
                you’re carrying debts, those should come first. Interest on
                credit cards, loans, or overdrafts usually grows faster than any
                savings account, so ignoring them only makes travel harder in
                the long run.
              </p>
              <p>
                By paying off debts first, you give your budget more breathing
                room and save yourself from extra stress caused by watching your
                debts grow. Even a small payment every month can make a big
                difference. Once your debts are under control, saving for a trip
                becomes easier and feels like a true reward for your hard work.

              <h4 id="cut-downs">Cut down on expenses</h4>
              <p>
                Once you have determined where your money goes after paying your
                rent and bills, then there is a time to think about where could
                you cut on. Let’s check - how many times you go for a coffee or
                having coffee to go, how many times you go out for drinks and
                eating out, how many times you end up impuls buying, what about
                memberships, subscriptions?
              </p>
              <p>
                Make a list of them all and think whether you could cut them
                off, eliminate, or look for cheaper alternatives. You will be
                surprised when you see how much extra money goes on these and
                maybe realize they are not that necessary to you, which will
                help you not only with saving for a trip but also with saving on
                anything else.

              <h4 id="side-hustle" class="mt-3 mt-lg-0">Start a Side Hustle</h4>
              <p>
                If your budget is really tight, starting a side hustle can give
                your savings a serious boost. This could be freelancing,
                tutoring, selling crafts, or offering a service in your local
                area — whatever fits your skills and schedule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even dedicating a few hours a week can make a noticeable
                difference. A side hustle not only helps you earn extra money
                for travel but also lets you explore your interests and develop
                new skills along the way. For example, you could sell handmade
                items on <strong>Etsy</strong>, flip clothes or second-hand
                finds on <strong>Vinted</strong>, or even launch your own online
                store with <strong>Shopify</strong>. Keep your goal in mind and
                celebrate each milestone as your fund grows. You can find out
                more below.

              <h4 id="saving-account">Open savings account</h4>
              <p>
                Opening a saving account to make sure you always have an amount
                of money saved aside for your travel is a great practice to make
                money saving consistent and effective. When you have a saving
                account opened you can order your bank to regularly post money
                to your saving account which will ensure that you will not spend
                more money than what is needed for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Banks are offering a variety of saving accounts and competing
                against each other to attract customers with perks like
                competitive interest rates, travel insurance, and other
                benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                My personal best choice is Revolut. Revolut offers Instant
                Access savings-Ultra with interest rate of 4.5%, with no fixed
                notice and you can deposit as little as £1. Another perk is that
                you can use it abroad without extra bank charges, exchange money
                easily, and even round up petty cash for extra saving. There are
                many other great options for savings accounts. You can see below
                one of the comparison sites that can help you choose the best
                one for you.
