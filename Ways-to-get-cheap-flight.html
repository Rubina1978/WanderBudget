                <h3>Tricks to find a cheap flights</h3>
                <p>First all I will be a a bit a spoiler but there is no any magic formula how to get cheap flights. We all have heard that "if you search flights incognito you will get cheap fare", "if you book on Monday or Wednesday you will get cheaper flight"... There is no proof of any of those, however there is few tricks you can try to get cheap flights.

                <h4>Be flexible with dates</h4>
                <p>Flight prices change for many reasons — holiday seasons like Christmas, New Year, and Easter are always the most expensive, while weekdays outside these periods are usually cheaper. Time of day matters too: early morning or late evening flights often cost less because fewer people can or want to travel these times. Weekends are usually more expensive since demand is higher.</p> 
                <p>The more flexibility you have the better chance for cheap fare you will have so if you can fly at less popular times and outside of the peak seasons, holidays or weekends, you are on the right way to find a cheap fare.</p>

                <article>
                <h4>Don't focus on major airports only</h4>
                <p>Similar patern like specific days and times goes also to airports. Always keep your eyes open and check flights from number of nearby airports. Many search engines have option to fly from nearby airports and you will often find out that the expensive flight for example from Manchester cost much less if you fly from London.</p>
                <p>UK airports have high airport duty which is added on top of the basic price together with fuel duty and some others, therefore if you plan to travel longhaul flight it is a good idea to fly to any European airport and then carry on your journey from there. It gives you better price and sometimes an oportunity to explore your stopover city as well.</p>

                <h4>Book early but not too early</h4>
                <p>Flights usually go on sale a year earlier but that is not good time to book. There is no specific time-scale when to book your flights but generally it is advised to book domestic flight a week ahead of departure, international flight 11 days before departure and within Europe about 30 days ahead but if you are planning to go during peak times then look three to 6 months ahead. However these are just a guidance and not set in stone. </p>

                <h4>Use your miles and points</h4>
                <p>If you travel frequently or planning to travel often then it is useful to sign up for any miles or point systems with airlines as when you accumulate certain amount of points or miles, you can get discount or even fly for free. You can earn huge amount of miles just by signing up with airlines without spending extra money and flying frequently<p>

            <p>One of the easiest ways to start looking for cheap flights is to use flight search engines. They gather fares from hundreds of airlines and booking sites, allowing you to compare prices in seconds. Most of these platforms also let you set up <em>price alerts</em>, so you’ll get notified when fares drop. Using a search engine doesn’t always mean you’ll book through it — sometimes it’s cheaper to go directly to the airline after finding the deal. But as a starting point, they are one of the most powerful tools for budget travelers.</p>
