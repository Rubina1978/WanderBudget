          <p>North America — and the United States in particular — is not always seen as a budget-friendly destination. Yet, being such a vast and diverse continent, the U.S. offers plenty even for travelers watching their spending. From vibrant cities and national parks to breathtaking landscapes, mountains, and beaches, there’s something for everyone.</p> 
          <p>While travel costs can be high and tourist infrastructure isn’t always the easiest to navigate, the U.S. is still a destination worth exploring. Even on a student budget, it’s possible to experience the highlights and create unforgettable memories without breaking the bank.</p>

            <p class="pt-3">The United States is full of possibilities for budget travelers, no matter what you’re into. Every state has its own personality — for me, it’s the mountains and famous landmarks that always call my name, while for others it might be the nightlife, beaches, or cultural scene. That’s the beauty of the U.S.: there’s truly something for everyone. Let’s look at a few ideas that prove you don’t need a big budget to enjoy this vast and diverse country. You can then read through my story bellow about how I travelled on student budget around 8 States by myself.</p>

            <h3 class="pb-3">How to get around</h3>
             <img  src="assets/images/IMAG1721 - Copy.webp" class="img-fluid rounded w-100 object-fit-cover" alt="three historic cars in front of old wooden white house and pol with old sign route 66, on right black historic car and another black on left, in the middle old red truck.">
             <p class="pt-3">United States is a huge country therefore there are number of ways to get around depending where you are.
             <h4 class="pt-3">Public transport</h4>
             <p >Public transport is an effective way to get around as most bigger cities and towns will have some sort of public transport - buses, trams, subway. In smaller towns and villages that could be a little problem as the public transport network in the U.S. is not as good as in Europe so always think about alternative.</p>
             <h4 class="pt-3">Ride sharing</h4>
             <p>Lyft or Uber are much cheaper alternatives so try to avoid normal taxis as they are the most expensive.</p>
             <h4 class="pt-3">Intercity buses</h4>
             <p> Buses are the cheapest and the best alternative, they run from most of places and are generally reliable and comfortable, just wear one more layer then usual as aircondition in buses is usually running on full blast so if you travel long distance for several hours it could be quite unpleasant experience. The most used bus companies are Flixbus, Greyhound and Megabus.</p>
             <h4 class="pt-3">Hitchhiking</h4>
             <p>Unlike in Europe that is fairly common and safe way to get around so if you feel adveturous make a cardboard sign and try your luck. You may wait for quite some time so be prepared with snacks and plenty of water.</p>

            <h3>When to travel</h3>
            <p>Because United States are so huge, it difficult to say when to travel as each side of the country has different climate so the temperature can change all the time. One day you will be experience extremely hot weather but when arrive to a different place you can get raining and cold or even snow in the middle of summer so when to travel will depend on where are you going and what are you planning to do.</p>
            <p>In the North the seasons are quite clear, places like New York and Boston will have cold winter with snow. Around the coast the we weather will be milder. In the central U.S. such as Colorado, there the weather can go from extreme to extreme such as snow in mid June or September for one or two days then sunny and hot. Warm weather will last until November then there will be a sudden dip for few days for example one day there can be 27 degrees and next day -27 degrees then it gets again mild.</p>
            <p>On the South you will mild and dry in winter time and extreme heat such as 50 degrees in summer and unless you like the heat, you do not want to be there. I have learned that the hard way as mentioned in my story about one month of travel on student budget around the United States</p>
