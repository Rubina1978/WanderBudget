                <h3>Tricks to find a cheap flights</h3>
                <p>First all I will be a a bit a spoiler but there is no any magic formula how to get cheap flights. We all have heard that "if you search flights incognito you will get cheap fare", "if you book on Monday or Wednesday you will get cheaper flight"... There is no proof of any of those, however there is few tricks you can try to get cheap flights.

                <h4>Be flexible with dates</h4>
                <p>Flight prices change for many reasons — holiday seasons like Christmas, New Year, and Easter are always the most expensive, while weekdays outside these periods are usually cheaper. Time of day matters too: early morning or late evening flights often cost less because fewer people can or want to travel these times. Weekends are usually more expensive since demand is higher.</p> 
                <p>The more flexibility you have the better chance for cheap fare you will have so if you can fly at less popular times and outside of the peak seasons, holidays or weekends, you are on the right way to find a cheap fare.</p>

                <article>
                <h4>Don't focus on major airports only</h4>
                <p>Similar patern like specific days and times goes also to airports. Always keep your eyes open and check flights from number of nearby airports. Many search engines have option to fly from nearby airports and you will often find out that the expensive flight for example from Manchester cost much less if you fly from London.</p>
                <p>UK airports have high airport duty which is added on top of the basic price together with fuel duty and some others, therefore if you plan to travel longhaul flight it is a good idea to fly to any European airport and then carry on your journey from there. It gives you better price and sometimes an oportunity to explore your stopover city as well.</p>

                <h4>Book early but not too early</h4>
                <p>Flights usually go on sale a year earlier but that is not good time to book. There is no specific time-scale when to book your flights but generally it is advised to book domestic flight a week ahead of departure, international flight 11 days before departure and within Europe about 30 days ahead but if you are planning to go during peak times then look three to 6 months ahead. However these are just a guidance and not set in stone. </p>

                <h4>Use your miles and points</h4>
                <p>If you travel frequently or planning to travel often then it is useful to sign up for any miles or point systems with airlines as when you accumulate certain amount of points or miles, you can get discount or even fly for free. You can earn huge amount of miles just by signing up with airlines without spending extra money and flying frequently.<p>

            <p>One of the easiest ways to start looking for cheap flights is to use flight search engines. They gather fares from hundreds of airlines and booking sites, allowing you to compare prices in seconds. Most of these platforms also let you set up <em>price alerts</em>, so you’ll get notified when fares drop. Using a search engine doesn’t always mean you’ll book through it — sometimes it’s cheaper to go directly to the airline after finding the deal. But as a starting point, they are one of the most powerful tools for budget travelers.</p>
            <p>To find the best flight deals you have to search on multiple platforms as each is different. Some will not show you budget airlines as they don't want to pay commission, others will not list non-english airlines. Non of the search engines are perfect and you will most likely find different deals on each of them.</p>

            <article class="pt-3">
                <p> After comparing prices on search engines, always check the airline’s own website before booking. Airlines often offer cheaper fares directly to encourage customers to book with them. Third-party sites may look like a bargain, but they usually make up the difference with hidden admin fees or inflated charges for extras like baggage. For example, a £50 bag fee with the airline might cost £60 or more through a third-party agent.</p>
                <p>The bigger issue comes if you need to change or cancel your flight. Since your contract is with the booking agent, not the airline, you’ll be sent back to the third party—often with added costs and delays. From my own experience working both for an airline and a booking company, I can tell you: booking directly is sometimes cheaper, simpler, and far less stressful.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Here are few examples of budget airlines I am using on my travels.</p>
                <strong><a href="http://https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="website opens in new window">Ryanair</a></strong> <p>Irish budget airline offering low cost flights on most European routes. As with most budget airlines, you need to purchase bags and seats separately, However Ryanair has an option to travel only with small backpack 40x30x20cm or you can book Priority which allows to have small backpack as well as regular carry on luggage if the plan is to travel the cheapest possible. </p>
                <strong><a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en">EasyJet</a></strong> <p>EasyJet offers not only flights but also packaged holidays through their sister company EasyJet Holidays. They also offer baggage and seats for extra charge, however their small bag allowance  more generous in dimensions 45x36x20cm and they offer an option to purchase large cabin bag, which also give you a speedy boarding to get to the aircraft first.</p>
                <strong><a href="http://www.jet2.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet2.com</a></strong> <p>Jet2 is third major budget airline I used to fly with. Similarly like EasyJet they also offer not only flights, but also packaged holidays through their sister company Jet2holidays. They are a little pricier than the two above, however their quality of aircrafts and service is spectacular. They are the most generous in cabin baggage allowances - you can bring small underseat bag of size 40x30x15cm plus standard size of carry on bag maximum of 10kg.</p>

            <div class="col-12 pb-3">
              <article>
                <p>Once you have done your homework, checked search engines, last-minute deals and airline offers, it is time to book the flight. It’s always better to book early rather than late — when you find a great deal, grab it, because good prices don’t last long and hesitation can mean missing out. Good deals will not be there for long and if you hesitate, you will loose out.</p>
                <p>The good news is that airlines let you book a flight and cancel within 24 hours for now extra charge so if you see something worthwhile,then continue checking for better options. Just don’t forget to set a reminder so you can cancel in time if needed.</p>
                <p>Don’t let yourself get stuck in endless research and miss the chance to plan the rest of your trip — accommodation, activities, and experiences. Personally, I never spend more than an hour looking for flights. I secure the ticket first and handle extras like seats or baggage later, closer to departure.</p>

                <p>So there you have it, now go ahead and book your dream trip - book smart and act fast.</p>
