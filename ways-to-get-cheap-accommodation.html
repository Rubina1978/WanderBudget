                <p>Finding affordable accommodation is one of the biggest challenges when planning a trip. While flights usually take the spotlight as the major expense, where you sleep every night can quietly eat up a large part of your budget but with a little strategy and flexibility, you don’t have to break the bank to find a comfortable place to stay.</p>

                <p>Today, there are more options than ever: hotels, hostels, guesthouses, short-term rentals, homestays, couchsurfing and other programs. Each has its own perks and trade-offs, and the “best” choice often depends on your travel style, location, and budget. With the right approach, you can cut costs dramatically while still enjoying safe and welcoming accommodation.</p>

                <p>In this section, we’ll look at different ways to score cheaper stays — from booking platforms to alternative lodging options and clever timing tricks. Whether you’re a backpacker or a traveler who likes a bit more comfort, these tips will help you find a place that fits both your budget and your travel dreams.</p>

      <h3>Tricks to get cheap accommodation</h3>
      <article>
      <p>When you want to travel and you are on tight budget then you will want to spend the least as possible on your flights and accommodation which took the biggest portion of your budget. In the same time you want to feel in your temporaty home comfortable, safe and in close reach to amenities, entertainment and sights, which mean you will want to be idealy somewhere central to the place where all the fun is happening and that could be quite challenging as the closer to city center, sights and all, you will normally have to pay much more than someonewhere on the outskirts.The good thing is, that is completely achievable and managable just with number of trick you can use whenever you travel no matter if it is holiday or business. But what are the tricks? Well, let's dive in and explore some of the tricks I have used myself when I was travelling or got inspired with by fellow budget travelers.</p>

      <h4>Be flexible</h4>
      <p>One of the best ways to save money on accommodation by being maximally flexible. Accommodation takes most of your budget and prices change depending on dates, location, and even the time of booking. If you’re set on a specific hotel in a specific neighborhood during peak season, chances are you’ll pay top price. But if you’re open to nearby areas, different room types, or adjusting your dates by a day or two, you can often find significantly cheaper rates.</p>
    
      <h4>Book early</h4>
      <p>You have a much better chance of scoring cheap accommodation and saving money if you plan ahead. Traveling during peak holidays and booking at the last minute usually leaves you with limited choices and much higher prices. It’s also important to remember that peak holiday times don’t always match the dates in your home country, so be sure to check local calendars before you book. A little foresight can go a long way toward keeping your budget under control.</p>

      <h4>Book with free cancellation</h4>
      <p>Many booking sites offer free cancellation up to 24 hours or even week before departure. To make sure you get the best deal, take full advantage of it, book your accommodation and then watch for the prices in case there would be some price drop or special offer.</p>

      <h4>Book directly</h4>
      <p>Most people looking for accommodation will first turn to third-party sites, but in many cases you’ll find better rates by booking directly with the provider. Third parties need to earn a commission, so if it’s not included in the price, it often appears as admin, change, or cancellation fees. They also take a percentage from the businesses themselves, which is why many hotels and guesthouses actually prefer direct bookings — it allows them to keep the full profit, and sometimes they’ll pass those savings on to you.</p>

      <h4>Check for city or tourist tax/payments for extra services</h4>
      <p>Always check whether your chosen location has tourist or city tax to pay. Many countries implemented city or tourist tax charges. they are usually charged per day, sometimes it will be added to your final bill and sometimes you have to pay by cash so it is always good to keep that in mind.</p>
      <p>Another important thing to find out is what is included in the rate and what you have to pay for extra - linen, breakfast, towels. Always check to avoid any unwanted surprises.</p>

        <p>Finding affordable places to stay is easier today thanks to accommodation search engines. These platforms gather listings from hotels, hostels, guesthouses, and rental sites, allowing you to compare prices, locations, and reviews all in one place. Instead of checking dozens of websites individually, you can quickly spot the best deals that fit your budget and travel style.</p>
        <p>Many search engines also offer filters for amenities, cancellation policies, and distance from key attractions, which makes narrowing down your options simple. Some even show flexible date searches, so you can see if shifting your trip by a day or two saves money.</p>

    <h3>Useful search engines</h3>
    <div class="col-12">
      <article>
      <p>The quickest accommodation search tool is <strong>Google Hotels</strong>, part of the Google search engine. Simply type your destination and travel dates into the search box, and it will display available hotels in the area — showing price, location, and star reviews. With filters, you can refine results to match your preferences and budget.</p> <p>There are also many other search engines that give you an overview of what’s available in your destination. While these are excellent tools for comparison, it’s always worth checking directly with the accommodation provider before booking. Often you’ll find lower rates or added perks when booking direct. Used wisely, accommodation search engines can save you time, money, and the stress of searching endlessly. Let’s take a look at some of the top sites as of September 2025.

  <h3>Traditional accommodation</h3>
  <div class="col-12">
    <article>
      <p>Accommodation is usually the second biggest part of your travel budget. Yet many travelers, when planning a trip, go straight to hotel search engines and book the cheapest hotel they can find—without considering other options. In reality, there are several types of accommodation that can be just as good, and sometimes even cheaper, especially if you’re traveling on a tight budget.</p> <p>The type of accommodation you choose often depends on what’s available in your destination and at what price. For example, in a city like Dublin you might easily pay £100 per night for a hostel bed, while in other places you can find a comfortable hotel room for £30. Another important factor is the level of comfort you’re seeking—or willing to sacrifice. </p> <p>Personally, I’m happy to stay in a hostel bunk bed in a shared dorm. It doesn’t bother me because when I travel, I spend most of my time out exploring and only use the room for sleep. For others, more privacy and comfort may be worth the extra cost. The key is to balance your budget, your needs, and the experience you want from your trip so lets have a look what accommodation is there besides hotel rooms.</p>
