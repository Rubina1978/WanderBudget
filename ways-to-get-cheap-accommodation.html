                <p>Finding affordable accommodation is one of the biggest challenges when planning a trip. While flights usually take the spotlight as the major expense, where you sleep every night can quietly eat up a large part of your budget but with a little strategy and flexibility, you don’t have to break the bank to find a comfortable place to stay.</p>

                <p>Today, there are more options than ever: hotels, hostels, guesthouses, short-term rentals, homestays, couchsurfing and other programs. Each has its own perks and trade-offs, and the “best” choice often depends on your travel style, location, and budget. With the right approach, you can cut costs dramatically while still enjoying safe and welcoming accommodation.</p>

                <p>In this section, we’ll look at different ways to score cheaper stays — from booking platforms to alternative lodging options and clever timing tricks. Whether you’re a backpacker or a traveler who likes a bit more comfort, these tips will help you find a place that fits both your budget and your travel dreams.</p>

            <p>When you want to travel and you are on tight budget then you will want to spend the least as possible on your flights and accommodation which took the biggest portion of your budget. In the same time you want to feel in your temporaty home comfortable, safe and in close reach to amenities, entertainment and sights, which mean you will want to be idealy somewhere central to the place where all the fun is happening and that could be quite challenging as the closer to city center, sights and all, you will normally have to pay much more than someonewhere on the outskirts.The good thing is, that is completely achievable and managable just with number of trick you can use whenever you travel no matter if it is holiday or business. But what are the tricks? Well, let's dive in and explore some of the tricks I have used myself when I was travelling or got inspired with by fellow budget travelers.</p>

            <h4>Be flexible</h4>
            <p>One of the best ways to save money on accommodation by being maximally flexible. Accommodation takes most of your budget and prices change depending on dates, location, and even the time of booking. If you’re set on a specific hotel in a specific neighborhood during peak season, chances are you’ll pay top price. But if you’re open to nearby areas, different room types, or adjusting your dates by a day or two, you can often find significantly cheaper rates.</p>
    
            <h4 class="pt-3">Book early</h4>
            <p>You have a much better chance of scoring cheap accommodation and saving money if you plan ahead. Traveling during peak holidays and booking at the last minute usually leaves you with limited choices and much higher prices. It’s also important to remember that peak holiday times don’t always match the dates in your home country, so be sure to check local calendars before you book. A little foresight can go a long way toward keeping your budget under control.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-3">Book with free cancellation</h4>
            <p>Many booking sites offer free cancellation up to 24 hours or even week before departure. To make sure you get the best deal, take full advantage of it, book your accommodation and then watch for the prices in case there would be some price drop or special offer.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-3">Book directly</h4>
            <p>Most people looking for accommodation will first turn to third-party sites, but in many cases you’ll find better rates by booking directly with the provider. Third parties need to earn a commission, so if it’s not included in the price, it often appears as admin, change, or cancellation fees. They also take a percentage from the businesses themselves, which is why many hotels and guesthouses actually prefer direct bookings — it allows them to keep the full profit, and sometimes they’ll pass those savings on to you.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-3">Check for city or tourist tax/payments for extra services</h4>
            <p>Always check whether your chosen location has tourist or city tax to pay. Many countries implemented city or tourist tax charges. they are usually charged per day, sometimes it will be added to your final bill and sometimes you have to pay by cash so it is always good to keep that in mind.</p>
            <p>Another important thing to find out is what is included in the rate and what you have to pay for extra - linen, breakfast, towels. Always check to avoid any unwanted surprises.</p>

          <h3 id="search-engines-for-accommodation">Search engines for accommodation</h3>
          <p>Finding affordable places to stay is easier today thanks to accommodation search engines. These platforms gather listings from hotels, hostels, guesthouses, and rental sites, allowing you to compare prices, locations, and reviews all in one place. Instead of checking dozens of websites individually, you can quickly spot the best deals that fit your budget and travel style.</p>
          <p>Many search engines also offer filters for amenities, cancellation policies, and distance from key attractions, which makes narrowing down your options simple. Some even show flexible date searches, so you can see if shifting your trip by a day or two saves money.</p>
          <p>I personally use search engines just to find out what is available in the area and then prefer booking direct if I can as many times found out it was even cheaper than with the search engines</p>

          <h4>Useful search engines</h4>
          <p>The quickest accommodation search tool is <strong>Google Hotels</strong>, part of the Google search engine. Simply type your destination and travel dates into the search box, and it will display available hotels in the area — showing price, location, and star reviews. With filters, you can refine results to match your preferences and budget.</p> <p>There are also many other search engines that give you an overview of what’s available in your destination. While these are excellent tools for comparison, it’s always worth checking directly with the accommodation provider before booking. Often you’ll find lower rates or added perks when booking direct. Used wisely, accommodation search engines can save you time, money, and the stress of searching endlessly. Let’s take a look at some of the top sites as of September 2025.

          <p>Accommodation is usually the second biggest part of your travel budget. Yet many travelers, when planning a trip, go straight to hotel search engines and book the cheapest hotel they can find—without considering other options. In reality, there are several types of accommodation that can be just as good, and sometimes even cheaper, especially if you’re traveling on a tight budget.</p> <p>The type of accommodation you choose often depends on what’s available in your destination and at what price. For example, in a city like Dublin you might easily pay £100 per night for a hostel bed, while in other places you can find a comfortable hotel room for £30. Another important factor is the level of comfort you’re seeking—or willing to sacrifice. </p> <p>Personally, I’m happy to stay in a hostel bunk bed in a shared dorm. It doesn’t bother me because  when I travel i explore and walk whole day so use the room for sleep. The key is to balance your budget, your needs, and the experience you want from your trip so lets have a look what accommodation is there besides hotel rooms.</p>

          <h3>Types of accommodation</h3>
          In this section, we’ll explore different types of accommodation you can choose from besides hotels, especially if you’re traveling on a budget. This won’t be an exhaustive list, but rather a look at practical options worth considering. When deciding what works best for you, ask yourself: <em>How much comfort do I really need to be happy while traveling?</em> The answer to that question will help you decide whether to stick with hotels or branch out and try something different. From the cheapest option such as camping, each option offers its own balance of cost, comfort, and experience.

          <h4>Campsites</h4>
          <p>Campsites are one of the cheapest accommodation options and can also be the most adventurous. Mostly you have to bring your own gear but many campsites offer rental one on-site or stay in a simple cabin, camping allows you to get close to nature while saving money. Many campsites provide basic facilities such as showers, kitchens, and even small shops. Some are right in the middle of popular tourist areas, making them a practical budget-friendly choice.</p>

          <p>Camping isn’t for everyone—it requires you to sacrifice comfort and sometimes deal with unpredictable weather and I have learned that many times, but for outdoor lovers or those traveling in warmer months, it’s an excellent way to cut accommodation costs while creating unique memories.</p>

    <h4>Hostels</h4>
    <article>
     <p>Hostels are one of the most popular choices for budget travelers. They usually offer dorm-style rooms with shared facilities, though many also have private rooms. While some people associate hostels with noise, lack of cleanliness, or cramped spaces, the reality today is much more diverse. Many modern hostels are clean, safe, and social, often providing kitchens, lounges, and organized activities that hotels rarely offer at the same price point.</p>

    <p>From my own experience, staying in hostels has always been a highlight of my travels. They’re fantastic for meeting other travelers, sharing stories, and sometimes having unique experiences that simply wouldn’t happen in a hotel. For example, in Las Vegas I stayed in a hostel that at first seemed a little rough—but it turned out to be one of the most fun experiences of my life. I joined a day trip to the Grand Canyon organized by the hostel, got into a fancy beach party on the Strip, made lifelong friends, and even rode in a limo. None of that would have happened if I’d booked a regular hotel. That’s the charm of hostels: they’re not just a place to sleep, but a gateway to connections and unexpected adventures.</p>

    <h4 class="pt-3">Bed and Breakfasts, Pensions, and Guest Houses</h4>
    <p>These types of accommodation are very similar, with the main difference being what they’re called in different regions. They usually provide rooms like a hotel, but are run by local hosts. That means you still get many of the comforts of a hotel, but with a more personal touch and a sense of authenticity. In some cases, you may need to share a bathroom with another room or two, but the chance to experience local hospitality and connect with your host is often priceless.</p>
    <p>They often include breakfast in the price, which can help you save money on food, and are usually cheaper than full-service hotels while offering more comfort and privacy than hostels. For travelers seeking a balance of affordability, local charm, and convenience, these can be an excellent option.</p>

    <h4 class="pt-3">Apartments and Aparthotels</h4>
    <p>Apartments and aparthotels are a great choice for travelers who want more space, flexibility, and independence. They usually come with a small kitchen or kitchenette, giving you the option to cook your own meals and save money compared to eating out every day. This makes them especially popular for families, groups, or anyone staying longer in one place.</p>
    <p>Aparthotels combine the comfort of a hotel with the facilities of an apartment, often offering services like cleaning, reception, or even breakfast while still giving you the freedom to self-cater. Prices can vary depending on location, but in many cases they offer better value for money than traditional hotels, especially when shared between several people.</p>

          <h3 id="alternative" class="pb-3">Alternative accommodation</h3>
          <p>In addition to traditional accommodation options, there are many alternative choices that can provide both unique experiences and considerable savings. These alternatives often go beyond just a place to sleep — they offer opportunities to connect with local hosts, gain authentic cultural insights, and sometimes enjoy a warmer, more personal touch than standard hotels.</p>

          <p>For budget-conscious travelers, they can also be an excellent way to stretch your money further without sacrificing comfort. From community-based stays to private rentals, each option has its own benefits depending on your travel style and expectations.</p>

          <p>Here are some of the most popular alternatives to consider on your journey:</p>

            <h3>Alternative accommodation types</h3>
            <article class="pt-3">
            <h4>Homestays</h4>
            <p>A homestay is when you rent a room within your host’s home. It’s one of the most authentic ways to experience local life, since you’re living under the same roof as a family or host. Beyond just a place to sleep, homestays often include shared meals, stories, and cultural exchange. This makes them ideal for travelers who value community engagement and want to immerse themselves in local traditions and daily routines.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-3">AirBnB</h4>
            <p>Airbnb started as a peer-to-peer hosting service and still offers opportunities for cultural exchange, but it has grown into a platform with a wide variety of accommodation types — from spare rooms in family homes to entire apartments or unique stays like cabins, boats, or treehouses. While it often provides more independence for travelers, it’s still usually cheaper than hotels. Be aware, however, of added costs such as cleaning or service fees. Even so, for many travelers Airbnb balances affordability with comfort, and sometimes still gives you the chance to connect with hosts.</p>
            <p>In my own travels, I’ve used Airbnb several times and always appreciated the flexibility and contact with the locals. Once I rented a room in Genoa — it was cheaper than nearby hotels, and my host gave me local tips I wouldn’t have found online and daily breakfast for no extra cost. She even helped me with getting train tickets and gave valuable advices so i could keep safe and explore fully. Experiences like that show how Airbnb can combine affordability with a more personal touch.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-3">Couchsurfing</h4>
            <p>With platforms like Couchsurfing, you can stay for free in someone’s home. It’s a great way to meet locals and fellow travelers, though it works best if you’re flexible and open-minded. You can combine multiple things in one - you meet with locals, have someone to socialise with, place to stay, making sometimes lifelong freindship and can get local information. I used couchsurfing a lot and have truly unforgetable memories and would do it anytime again.The people I met, things I experinced with them I could never get anywhere else and they would make another story.</p>
            <p>The way it works is that you create a profile, search for hosts in your destination, and send requests to stay with them. Hosts usually offer a spare room or couch, and in return, you’re expected to be respectful, sociable, and sometimes help out with small tasks. It’s not just about saving money; it’s about cultural exchange and building connections. Just remember to read reviews and choose hosts carefully to ensure a safe and positive experience.Here are some tips to increase your chance to get response:</p>
            <ul id="couchsurfing" class="w-75" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgb(175, 175, 175);">
              <li>Make sure you create and keep up to date profile with multiple pictures of yourself and with friends</li>
              <li>Always read reviews - even better when they are verified.</li>
              <li>Make sure they are active</li>
              <li>To get reviews start with meeting couchsurfers in your area and wherever you go - couchcrashes and other gatherrings are perfect way to get to know people and get reviews.</li>
              <li>Use your judgement, if it does not feel right don't stay</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Other ways to find an accommodation</h3>
        <p>If you want something completely different to have an even more unique experience, besides the usual places to stay, there are some really cool programs that can help you travel for way less (or even free) while giving you experiences money can’t buy.</p> 
        <p>With things like WWOOF you can work on organic farms, Workaway connects you with families and projects that need a hand, and house- or pet-sitting lets you live like a local while looking after someone’s home. You can even stay in a monastery for a unique, peaceful experience or join communities like Host a Sister to connect with locals. These options aren’t just about saving money — they’re about making your trip more personal and memorable. Workaway in particular is my plan to experience when I am travelling again</p>

        <h4>WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms)</h4>
        <p>WWOOF connects travelers with organic farms around the world. In exchange for a few hours of daily work, you get free accommodation and meals. It’s perfect if you don’t mind getting your hands dirty and want to live close to nature. WWOOF is great option for longer travel without braking the bank. It matches travelers who want to work on the farm with farmers looking for workers.</p>
        <p>The way it works is that you have to sign up from whichever country you want - there is no one universal membership, you have to get it for each country.Then you pay membership fee which will be different in each country and then can start WWhooping. Even though you have to pay membership fee it will still work much cheaper than regular hotel so if you would visit hundreds of countries with thousands of participants worldwide you would save huge amount of money a year.</p>
