                <p>Finding affordable accommodation is one of the biggest challenges when planning a trip.

                <p>In this section, we’ll look at different ways to score cheaper stays — from booking platforms to alternative lodging options and clever timing tricks.

      <p>The good thing is, that is completely achievable and managable just with number of trick you can use whenever you travel no matter if it is holiday or business. But what are the tricks? Well, let's dive in and explore some of the tricks I have used myself when I was travelling or got inspired with by fellow budget travelers.</p>

      <h4>Be flexible</h4>
      <p>One of the best ways to save money on accommodation by being maximally flexible. Accommodation takes most of your budget and prices change depending on dates, location, and even the time of booking. If you’re set on a specific hotel in a specific neighborhood during peak season, chances are you’ll pay top price. But if you’re open to nearby areas, different room types, or adjusting your dates by a day or two, you can often find significantly cheaper rates.</p>
    
      <h4>Book early</h4>
      <p>You have a much better chance of scoring cheap accommodation and saving money if you plan ahead. Traveling during peak holidays and booking at the last minute usually leaves you with limited choices and much higher prices. It’s also important to remember that peak holiday times don’t always match the dates in your home country, so be sure to check local calendars before you book. A little foresight can go a long way toward keeping your budget under control.</p>

      <h4>Book with free cancellation</h4>
      <p>Many booking sites offer free cancellation up to 24 hours or even week before departure. To make sure you get the best deal, take full advantage of it, book your accommodation and then watch for the prices in case there would be some price drop or special offer.</p>

      <h4>Book directly</h4>
      <p>Most people looking for accommodation will first turn to third-party sites, but in many cases you’ll find better rates by booking directly with the provider. Third parties need to earn a commission, so if it’s not included in the price, it often appears as admin, change, or cancellation fees. They also take a percentage from the businesses themselves, which is why many hotels and guesthouses actually prefer direct bookings — it allows them to keep the full profit, and sometimes they’ll pass those savings on to you.</p>

      <h4>Check for city or tourist tax/payments for extra services</h4>
      <p>Always check whether your chosen location has tourist or city tax to pay. Many countries implemented city or tourist tax charges. they are usually charged per day, sometimes it will be added to your final bill and sometimes you have to pay by cash so it is always good to keep that in mind.</p>
      <p>Another important thing to find out is what is included in the rate and what you have to pay for extra - linen, breakfast, towels. Always check to avoid any unwanted surprises.</p>
