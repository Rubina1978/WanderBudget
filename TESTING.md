## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## User Story Testing

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Testing User Stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **Features** should already align with the **User Stories**, so this should be as simple as creating a table with the User Story, matching with the re-used screenshot from the respective Feature.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

| Target | Expectation | Outcome | Screenshot | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| As a user | I would like to see examples of why I should join | so that I can learn about the club’s mission and purpose before deciding to join. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature01.png) |
| As a user | I would like to view the running schedule/timetable | so that I can decide when to join a session. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature02.png) |
| As a user | I would like to see the details of different running events | so that I can prepare accordingly. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature03.png) |
| As a user | I would like to view a gallery of past events | so that I can see photos of myself and others from previous runs. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature04.png) |
| As a user | I would like to sign up for the running club | so that I can join the community and participate in events. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature05.png) |
| As a user | I would like to follow the club on various platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) | so that I can stay updated with club news and events. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06.png) |
| As a user | I would like the website to be fully responsive | so that I can easily navigate and access information from my phone, tablet, or desktop. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature07.png) |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature08.png) |
